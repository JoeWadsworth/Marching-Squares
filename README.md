# Marching-Squares
This is an implementation of the marching squares algorithm. You can try this out here: https://joewadsworth.github.io/Marching-Squares/

## Information
__Marching Squares__ is a computer graphics algorithm that generates an approximation for a contour line of a two-dimensional scalar field. It can be applied in many areas, such as creating the contour lines on gradient maps. Even more, you could go further with the marching cubes algorithm and generate isosurfaces.
